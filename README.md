# About

"Shoji" is the Japanese word for the typical sliding doors with paper fillings and wooden frames.
The individual kanji in the logo have individual meanings that reflect the essence and features of this project:

型 (kata) - meaning "form," "type," or "template"
構 (kou) - meaning "structure" or "framework"
編 (hen) - meaning "edit" or "compile"
文 (bun/mon) - meaning "document" or "text"

The shoji metaphor captures both the transparency (you can see your data) and the structural flexibility (dynamic sliding doors to reconfigure views based on Entity types and user needs).

Together, 編集 (henshū) actually forms a compound word meaning "editing" or "compilation" - which captures both the individual manipulation of files (編) and their organized collection/management (集).

This pairing expresses the core functionality of this SEN Labs project: the ability to edit and organize files as structured objects.
